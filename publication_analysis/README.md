# Description

This directory contains code used for the publication, specifically to evaluate external models and PSSMs, analyze HSM models and HSM/P predictions, and create all figures. Detailed descriptions are provided in each subdirectory.

## External models

Code used to evaluate NetPhorest 2.1 predictions on HSM datasets is provided in `netphorest/`. Code used to evaluate PepInt predictions on HSM datasets is provided in `pepint/`.

## PSSMs

Code to construct benchmark PSSMs for each PBD family is provided in `pssm/`.

## Analysis and results presented in manuscript

All code used to perform analysis presented in the manuscript and create figures is provided in `results/`. Data underlying the figures is released on [figshare (doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.22105529)](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22105529), with a directory structure paralleling that of this directory.
